Forge Essentials
For Minecraft servers (and with added goodies for clients)
 
News
Apparently our old thread got wiped, so here's a new one.

About
With the recent discontinuation of the MCPortCentral integrated build, most server owners would be looking for an alternative to
 
the craftbukkit addons they use. Forge Essentials aims to solve this problem. We are a bukkit plugin replacement (not port!) for
 
use on Minecraft Forge powered servers, with many features designed to help the average server with what they used to do with
 
certain bukkit plugins.
 
Overview
We aim to provide the following features:
Provide essential commands for server management and usage, like the Essentials and CommandBook plugins
Provide an interface to use WorldEdit and WorldGuard in a Minecraft Forge SMP environment
Provide a basic permissions system for other mods to implement, extend and use (PEX-compatible)
Provide a world protection solution for Minecraft Forge powered servers

Download (Universal)
Current version is pre2 for Minecraft 1.4.5:

ForgeEssentials is primarily meant to be used as a server-addon, however, extra features can be enabled when the mod is installed
 
on your client. These include a WorldEdit-like CUI, as well as any future GUIs that require rendering client-side.
