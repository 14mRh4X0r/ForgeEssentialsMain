This is a test build, compiled from repo commit . Not tested much, but that's why this build is being released :)
Install Instructions:
Extract this zip into your minecraft folder. If using a mod manager, simply place coremods/FEPreLoader.jar into the coremods section and mods/ForgeEssentials.zip into the mods section. Have fun testing!
If you encounter any bugs:
1) File a ticket on the github ( https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentialsMain ) or
2) Contact any of us on the IRC ( #forgeessentials on Espernet)
Thanks!
