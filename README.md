ForgeEssentialsMain
===================
The Forge Essentials project consists of a permissions and protection system to be used with forge servers, incorporating WorldEdit and WorldGuard functionality. More info can be found at the #forgeessentials IRC channel on EsperNet.

Setup
=====
Minecraft: 1.4.5b (yes, a patch to 1.4.5)  
MCP: 7.23  
Forge: #393 (later builds may work, there is no Forge RB for 1.4.5b yet)

Get the mentioned Forge and MCP, and decompile (using install.cmd/sh). Once you have a working Forge workspace, pull the repo into that MCP folder.
When more than one contributor is online, we use Saros to collaborate.
